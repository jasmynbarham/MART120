I am a total beginner with GUI and Command Line Interface. 
After watching the brief videos about them both, my preference right now is for GUI. 
It is what I’m used to since Windows and Apple use it. I’ve never used Command Line Interface before now, but I’m excited to learn. 
Right off the bat, it looks more challenging just because of its layout. 
It actually reminds me a lot of the system I use at my job.
 I rent cars and the software we use was made in the 1980s and it strongly resembles the Command Line Interface. 
The GUI is more visual and easier to follow since it doesn’t all look the same and blend together like the command line interface.
