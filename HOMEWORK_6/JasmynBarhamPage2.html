        My name is Jasmyn. I am a student at the University of Montana. I am 21 years old and a Montana native. I currently am going to school and working at the airport renting cars. I hope to finish my degree in two years and move onto getting my career in filmmaking started. This class is definitely challenging, but I'm excited to continue learning and to hopefully master this craft.
